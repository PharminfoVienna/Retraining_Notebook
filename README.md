# Retraining_Notebook
Using Jupyter Notebooks for Re-training Machine Learning Models


A Jupyter Notebook is provided to generate/retrain classification models for six transporter proteins (BCRP, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MRP3, P-gp). Four different classifiers can be selected without an extensive descriptor selection and hyperparameter search as they have been pre-selected. An in-house data set can be combined with the available UNIVIE data set(s) to extend the chemical space of the model. 

Getting Started
-	Download files from the repository
-	Install Anaconda on your device 
-	Install/activate the virtual environment
-	Start the Jupyter Notebook

There are four sections available in the code:
1.	Data Collection
2.	Data Set Preparation for ML Task
3.	Applicability Domain
4.	Model Generation & Evaluation

Please follow the instructions in file <b>*Tutorial_Jupyter_Notebooks.pdf*</b>. A star next to the title/header indicates that an action from your side is required.
